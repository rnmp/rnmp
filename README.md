# Heyoo, I'm Rolando 👋<br />Jack of all trades, master of some.

I design & build apps that help you slow down  
and have fun with your thoughts. I'm based in  
Philly though originally from Peru/Bolivia.

When I'm not building, I'm probably watching  
horror movies, playing Rocket League, or riding   
Nitro at Six Flags.
