Not quite sure what happened this year but I definitely feel like it was momentous.

In no particular order:

- Traveled to China for the first time. Got to see Shanghai and met my wife's extended family.
- Grew my following on social media considerably. [Mainly in Threads](https://www.threads.com/@rnmp) which somehow surprises people as a place that exists.
- Earned 4 figures on an app I built. Which gave me validation to try new ideas over and over.
- Got back to my web roots and built [Ballpark.](https://ballpark.cc) Also revived one of [my favorite past projects](https://coleure.rolando.is) based on that experience.
- Went camping with my son and made some legit steak.
- Went to Six Flags (obviously.)
- Switched jobs to a more [fulfilling and challenging management position.](https://air.inc)
- Traveled to Bolivia and visited the Uyuni Salt Flats. My wife got to meet my extended family which was super important to me.
- Finally grew plants and they haven't died (trying hard not to jinx it.)
- Kiiiinda retired from YouTube, for now. It's proven a bit hard to justify given my limited amount of time.
- Freelanced a bit which broaden my horizons in the indie scene. 
- Went to the movie theater all by myself like a big boy to watch Bring Her Back.
- Fell more in love with Philly since the move from NY/NJ.
- Got my finances in order (more or less.)
- Went back to therapy with a wonderful counselor who's very flexible.
- Slooowly managing to have a healthier sleep schedule.
- Went to Mexico City with the company which was really fun. Got to try some costras which were delish.
- Karaoke'd 3 times because you have to. Also started singing lessons (I take this seriously.)
- Went to Mallorca for Cyan's 30th. My favorite part was driving in the country side with some good music vibes with our friends.
- Stopped going to the gym as much. But I am eating healthier/less.
- Went to see Japanese Breakfast and SPELLLING. Separate occassions, both vibey.
- Read (ok, half-read) Courage to be Disliked but thoroughly enjoyed the philosophy.
- Taught my son the foundations of how to code with and without AI.
- Also finally got to spend time in Toronto proper for a couple of days. Surprisingly great Asian food.

If I think of more I'll add. I still got like 29 more days, right?
